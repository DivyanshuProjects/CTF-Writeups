 Approach & Solution

 ðŸ”Ž Step 1: Identifying an Unused Image File
While inspecting the page source, I noticed a reference to an image file:

```ini
src="background.png"
```
However, the page didnâ€™t display any background image, which seemed suspicious.

 ðŸ”Ž Step 2: Accessing the Hidden Image

```bash
https://example.com/background.png
```
ðŸ’¡ Boom! The flag was inside the image file.

- Manually test file URLs to uncover hidden content.
- Developer tools are your best friend (`Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12`).
